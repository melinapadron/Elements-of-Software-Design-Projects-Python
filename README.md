# Python Projects

Hello! My name is Melina and I am a Junior Mathematics student at the University of Texas at Austin. I am also pursuing certificates in Scientific Computation and Data Sciences as well as Elements of Computing.

In the files above, there are some python projects that I have worked on to gain some experience with utilizing python. 

I'm an aspiring data scientist who loves finding patterns/ connecting dots and am highly interested in research that aims to facilitate improvements in daily life. I am an analytics-driven team player with a self-starter mentality who thrives in challenging, dynamic environments.

I would love to chat with you, so please do not hesitate to
